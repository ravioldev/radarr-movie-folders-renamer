## [1.2] - 2025-06-27

### üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIX
- **EMERGENCY PATCH**: Fixed critical security vulnerability that could copy entire Radarr installation to movie folders
- **SAFETY SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive safety checks to prevent data corruption

### Fixed
- **üõ°Ô∏è Critical Security Vulnerability**: Fixed dangerous `copy_tree` function that was copying entire directories
  - Old behavior: `rsync -a` copied ALL files from source directory
  - New behavior: Only copies video files and subtitles using selective inclusion patterns
  - Added safety checks to prevent copying from system directories
- **üîç Directory Validation**: Added multi-layer validation to detect and reject dangerous source directories
  - Radarr installation directory detection (Radarr.exe, bin/, config.xml, etc.)
  - System directory protection (Program Files, ProgramData, AppData)
  - Executable file count validation (rejects directories with >10 .exe/.dll files)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Issues**: Fixed inconsistent SCRIPTS_DIR path in configuration

### Added
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safety Checks**: Multiple safety validation layers
  - Source directory composition analysis (video vs executable file ratios)
  - Radarr installation indicator detection
  - System directory pattern matching
  - File count and type validation
- **üîí Safe RSYNC Options**: Implemented selective file copying
  - Only includes video files (.mkv, .mp4, .avi, etc.)
  - Only includes subtitle files (.srt, .sub, .idx)
  - Explicitly excludes all other file types
- **üö´ Automatic Rejection**: Script now automatically rejects dangerous operations
  - Exit codes 97-103 for different safety violations
  - Detailed logging of safety check failures
  - Clear error messages explaining why operations were rejected

### Changed
- **RSYNC_OPTIONS**: Now uses selective inclusion instead of copying everything
  - Old: `-a --ignore-existing` (copied everything)
  - New: `--include="*.mkv" --include="*.mp4" ... --exclude="*"` (selective copying)
- **copy_tree Function**: Completely rewritten with safety-first approach
  - Pre-operation safety validation
  - File type analysis before copying
  - Protection against system directory operations

### Security Impact
- **PREVENTS**: Accidental copying of Radarr installations to movie folders
- **PREVENTS**: Mass copying of system files and executables
- **PREVENTS**: Data corruption from processing wrong directories
- **ENSURES**: Only movie-related files are ever copied

### Immediate Action Required
- **UPDATE IMMEDIATELY**: This version fixes a critical security vulnerability
- **VERIFY SETUP**: Run the safety verification to ensure all protections are active
- **BACKUP FIRST**: Always backup your Radarr configuration before processing

## [1.1] - 2025-06-27

### Added
- **üéØ Selective Processing**: Target specific movies instead of processing your entire library
- **üîç Smart Filters**: Multiple filtering options for precise movie selection
  - `-FilterPath "text"`: Filter movies with specific text in folder path (configurable)
  - `-FilterNoQuality`: Filter movies without quality defined or missing files
  - `-DaysBack N`: Filter movies added/modified in the last N days
  - `-SearchTitle "text"`: Filter movies with text in title
- **üß™ Preview Mode**: See exactly what would be changed before making any modifications (`-DryRun`)
- **‚ö° Enhanced Safety**: Multiple safety features for better control
  - Preview mode to see changes before applying
  - Selective processing instead of all-or-nothing approach
  - Better error handling and logging
- **üìö Comprehensive Documentation**: Updated README with extensive examples and use cases

### Changed
- **FilterPath Parameter**: Replaced fixed `FilterUnknown` switch with configurable `FilterPath` string parameter
- **Processing Logic**: Filters are now applied before Skip/MaxMovies for better control
- **Status Messages**: Enhanced progress reporting with filter-specific information
- **Safety Features**: Improved error handling and user confirmation

### Technical Details
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility with existing commands
- All new parameters are optional - existing scripts continue to work unchanged
- Enhanced logging shows filter application results
- Combinable filters allow for precise targeting (e.g., `-FilterPath "[Unknown]" -FilterNoQuality -DaysBack 7`)

### Examples
```powershell
# See what movies would be processed (no changes made)
.\run.ps1 -FilterPath "[Unknown]" -DryRun

# Process only movies with "[Unknown]" in folder path
.\run.ps1 -FilterPath "[Unknown]"

# Process movies without quality defined
.\run.ps1 -FilterNoQuality

# Process movies added in the last 7 days
.\run.ps1 -DaysBack 7

# Combine filters for precise targeting
.\run.ps1 -FilterPath "temp" -FilterNoQuality -DaysBack 30
```
